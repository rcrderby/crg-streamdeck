# Stream Deck Control for CRG

## Status

[![Super-Linter](https://github.com/rcrderby/crg-streamdeck/actions/workflows/lint-files.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

## Overview

This repository includes resources that allow you to control the [CRG ScoreBoard](https://github.com/rollerderby/scoreboard "CRG ScoreBoard Git Repository") application for roller derby with an [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck "Elgato Stream Deck").

Every roller derby SBO [^1] has a preferred way to interact with the CRG Scoreboard application.  Some SBOs use a mouse exclusively, some use a mouse with a standard keyboard and small handful of key mappings, some use highly-customized keyboard controllers, and some even use gaming console controllers.

Stream Desk is just one more way to operate a roller derby scoreboard that we've found helps new SBOs overcome intimidation with the standard CRG Scoreboard Operator Panel ([example](/docs/images/crg/crg-operator-panel.png "CRG Scoreboard Operator Panel Example Image")) by presenting a simpler, colorized version of the most common SBO functions in a self-contained unit ([example](/docs/images/32-button/stream-deck-32-black-vs-white-page-1.png "Stream Deck Example Image")).

## Stream Deck Introduction and Support

Stream Deck controllers are devices with a number of customizable LED keys/buttons that connect to a Windows or macOS computer via USB.  Among other things, you may assign Stream Deck keys to send specific keystrokes to a computer and you can align those keystrokes with CRG Operator key mappings to control CRG with a Stream Deck.

Any Stream Deck platform should be able to control CRG, and this repository contains content for the following Stream Deck controllers:
